# INTRODUCTION

Hello World and Calculator program

Aim: The aim of this experiment is to study and implement the basic structure of a C++ program, focusing on understanding the different data types available. This includes writing and executing simple programs such as printing "Hello World" and creating a basic calculator to perform arithmetic operations.

Procedure:

Open a C++ IDE or text editor.

Write a simple program to print "Hello World" using the iostream library.

Compile and run the program to verify output.

Write a calculator program to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Declare variables with appropriate data types like int and float.

Take input values from the user using cin.

Use arithmetic operators to perform calculations.

Display results using cout.

Compile and run the calculator program to check correctness.

Conclusion: This experiment helped in understanding the basic syntax and structure of C++ programs. It provided hands-on experience with different data types and using input-output operations. Writing the "Hello World" and calculator programs reinforced knowledge of how to declare variables, use arithmetic operators, and perform simple computations, which forms the foundation of C++ programming.
